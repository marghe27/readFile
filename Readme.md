## About

It reads the file data, cleans them by removing spaces, asterisks and other chars 
and sorts them according to the "DY" column of the days of the month, inserting them into a HTML 
table. Then, this app compares this "DY" column of the table with  "MxT" and "MnT" columns, which 
contain the maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively, in a certain day. 
Finally, it sorts,  the whole table, by the day with the smallest temperature range.
